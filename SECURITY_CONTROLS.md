# Secure Movie Service - Security Controls

This document outlines the security controls implemented in the **Secure Movie Service** microservice. The service is designed with security integrated throughout the design, build, and deployment stages to protect sensitive data and ensure a resilient, reliable application.

---

## 1. Design-Level Security Controls

- **Least Privilege Principle:**  
  The service runs with minimal required privileges. For example, the Docker container runs as a non-root user to reduce risk if compromised.

- **Secure API Design:**  
  - Input validation is enforced to avoid injection attacks and ensure data integrity.  
  - Proper HTTP methods and status codes are used to enforce RESTful API standards.

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  (If applicable) The API endpoints are secured using OAuth2 / JWT tokens or other mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access.

- **Secrets Management:**  
  Sensitive credentials such as database passwords, API keys, and tokens are managed securely using environment variables or secret managers rather than hardcoded.

## 2. Development-Level Security Controls

- **Dependency Management:**  
  - Use of a `requirements.txt` file with pinned versions to avoid supply chain attacks.  
  - Regular scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like **Bandit** and **Trivy**.

- **Static Code Analysis:**  
  - Integration of **CodeQL** to detect common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and insecure configurations during development.

- **Secure Coding Practices:**  
  - Adherence to PEP8 and security best practices in Python.  
  - Avoidance of insecure functions or patterns (e.g., eval, exec).

- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  - Sensitive information is excluded from logs.  
  - Logs are structured for easy monitoring and anomaly detection.

## 3. Build & Deployment Security Controls

- **Container Security:**  
  - Use of multi-stage Docker builds to minimize image size and reduce attack surface.  
  - Running containers with non-root users to limit potential damage.  
  - Image scanning with **Trivy** for vulnerabilities before deployment.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Security:**  
  - Automated security scanning integrated into GitHub Actions workflows for Bandit, Trivy, and CodeQL scans.  
  - Pull request approvals and branch protection rules to enforce code review and prevent unauthorized changes.

- **Configuration Management:**  
  - Use of environment variables or secure vaults for secrets injection during deployment.  
  - Avoid committing sensitive information in code or version control.

## 4. Runtime Security Controls

- **Network Security:**  
  - Restrict inbound and outbound network traffic using firewalls or security groups to only necessary ports (e.g., port 8000 for FastAPI).

- **Resource Isolation:**  
  - Use container orchestration or server isolation techniques to limit resource access.

- **Health Checks & Failures:**  
  - Regular health checks to monitor service status and auto-restart on failures.

---

## 5. Incident Response and Maintenance

- **Vulnerability Management:**  
  - Regular updates of dependencies and base images to patch known vulnerabilities.  
  - Scheduled security audits and penetration testing.

- **Access Control:**  
  - Principle of least privilege for repository and deployment environments.  
  - Audit logs maintained for all access and changes.

- **Backup and Recovery:**  
  - Backup procedures for persistent data (if applicable).  
  - Tested recovery plans to minimize downtime.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements

- Implement API rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse.  
- Enforce HTTPS with TLS certificates for secure transport.  
- Implement detailed audit logging and alerting for suspicious activities.

# Summary

The Secure Movie Service implements a defense-in-depth strategy covering multiple layers of securityâ€”from secure design, safe coding practices, automated security scanning in CI/CD, to hardened container deployment. Continuous monitoring and regular maintenance ensure resilience against evolving threats.
